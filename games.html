                <h1><u>VALORANT</u></h1>
                <p> Valorant is a first-person-shooter game that is simlar to Counter Strike Global Offensive. 
                    The main difference are that there are agents and each agent have different abilities.
                    For example, Jett, the agent I was playing in the clip below, has a dash that propels you forward quickly, has an updraft that allows her to use the wind to bring herself in the air, 
                    and her special move, called an ultimate, are knives which one shot any person in the head, and 50 damage to the body. She also has a passive ability that not all agents have which is to slowly float then fall down if you hold space. Of course, all agents are not exactly the same as Jett. Every Agent have their own unnique abilities that can help change the pace of the game.
                </p>
                <p>I enjoy the game since it is really similar to Counter Strike which I have 500+ hours on. 
                    I can't say if it's better than Valorant, but I know that I am playing Valorant more now. 
                    The skins in Valorant don't have as much variety though. 
                    In Counter Strike, you can buy almost any skin from the community market on Steam, but in Valorant, there is no community market. 
                    Only your own personal shop that rerolls every day. 
                    If you don't find a skin you want, then you have to wait another day. This feature I dislike, but it doesn't have an effect in the game.</p>
